“*Rejsekort (Official translation: TRAVEL CARD) is an electronic ticket system for public transport in Denmark. The system is a collaborative work between DSB, HUR, Ørestadsselskabet, and various regional bus companies, and work on it started on August 18, 2003.*”
(Wikipedia)

Okay. So they began the work in 2003? Then it must be up and running now, right? No? No. 10 years later and it is still not working properly. **Not even close**. In fact, the Danish State Railways just prolonged the use of the old ticket coupon for another year, due to problems with Rejsekort. 

<!-- more -->

The ticket coupon system has been the cheapest and easiest way to travel around Copenhagen for many years. You buy a coupon valid for 10 trips with the number of zones you would like to travel. Everyone can buy it, everyone can use it. Before a trip you just validate the card at the station. It’s also easy to see how many trips you have left. 

The new travel card is different in many ways. The first step is to order a card from [rejsekort.dk][ref1]. When you receive the card, you have to transfer money to the card via a special terminal or their own self service website. Now you are ready to use the card. 
Whenever you use public transportation, you use the travel card to check in at a designated stand. When you have finished your journey you check out at another stand. Every time you change from metro to bus etc. you have to check in again. If four hours have passed and you haven’t checked out, you get fined 50 DKK. Thus the minimum card balance has to be 50 DKK to be able to check in. 
I could keep going for two pages if I had to mention all the rules and regulations. 

##So what’s wrong with it? 

Ordering a travel card. That should be easy. It isn’t.. There are over 6 different cards to choose from. Young, adult, child, senior, dog, bike, disabled etc. Furthermore you can choose a personal card, an anonymous card or a flex card. These different types of cards all have different rules and regulations. Shit. 

Secondly, the travel card is NOT available for tourists. This means the tourists are restricted to buying standard tickets at twice the price of traveling with a ticket coupon. What were they thinking? It’s possible for tourists to get a city pass. But that’s only valid for a certain amount of hours. 

If you are traveling with others it is possible to check in more people on one card. To do so you have to find a special stand. Only some of the stands is equipped with “the extra settings”. This is insane. 

Because of the minimum card balance you can be stuck between changing transportation, not being able to check in because of a low card balance. When checking out, the stand shows the card balance, which you obviously then have to remember to be sure to be able to complete your next trip. Can I just check the card balance on their website then? Yeah, you can. But it’s not optimised for mobile use, at all. And, if you choose to transfer money to the card online, you have to wait 24 hours before you can use the card! 

The travel card is also supposed to encourage some commuters to travel outside rush hours by adding a discount at certain hours of the day. That’s fine. But during the time I used the card I experienced odd pricing and several times I was charged more than I expected. The pricing is different than the known ticket coupon and certainly not transparent enough. 

The worst thing is that the new travel card system isn’t connected to the the existing commute pass. Even though you already payed your monthly fee for traveling in specific zones, the travel card doesn’t know that, and you risk to pay for the same area twice. 

**Have anyone thought this through before deciding to spend over 1 billion DKK on the project?**

For now, the use of the old ticket coupons is prolonged and we can only hope that someone will wake up and turn the project around. The travel card definitely has potential as we have seen in other countries, but there is still a lot to fix.
